# 3D Inventory Management System

Welcome to the 3D Inventory Management System, the starting block for organizing your burgeoning 3D printing empire! This project is a grassroots approach to taming the wild, often chaotic, world of managing your 3D printing resources. Think of it as your digital quartermaster, eager and ready to keep tabs on all that precious filament and those elusive spare parts.

## A Little Bit About This Project

Crafted with the finesse of a 3D-printed Benchy, this system is designed for small business owners knee-deep in the world of 3D printing. It's your first step towards bringing order to the chaos of creativity. While it may not have the bells and whistles of a full-fledged inventory management system yet, it lays down a solid foundation. With some TLC and a bit of coding magic, it can grow to meet all your inventory needs.

### Made With:

- **Java**: The backbone of this project, providing the structure and logic.
- **Spring Boot**: For those who want to dive straight into development without wrestling with configuration.
- **JavaScript & A Dash of CSS**: Adding that sprinkle of interactivity and style to make everything nice and user-friendly.
- **MySQL**: Storing all your data safely in a database, ensuring everything is organized and easily accessible.
- **XAMPP**: A handy tool for managing the MySQL database locally, making it easy to kickstart your development environment.

### Current Features:

- Basic management capabilities for printers, filaments, resins, and extras.
- A somewhat playful interface that doesnâ€™t take life too seriously.
- Connection to a MySQL database for persistent storage of all your inventory items.
- A good base for expansion, experimentation, and customization.

### To-Do List:

- Implement security measures to protect your precious inventory data from the prying eyes of rival printers.
- Add more features, bells, and whistles to transform this base into a comprehensive inventory system.
- Optimize the existing codebase because, let's face it, there's always room for improvement.
- Enhance database interactions for more advanced functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository, and ensure you have Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and XAMPP set up on your machine. Run XAMPP to manage the database locally and execute the application. From there, navigate through the setup to see your 3D inventory come to life. Detailed instructions will be added soon, so stay tuned!
